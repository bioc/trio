Description: Testing SNPs and SNP interactions with a genotypic TDT. This package
   furthermore contains functions for computing pairwise values of LD measures and 
   for identifying LD blocks, as well as functions for setting up matched 
   case pseudo-control genotype data for case-parent trios in order to run 
   trio logic regression, for imputing missing genotypes in trios, for simulating 
   case-parent trios with disease risk dependent on SNP interaction, and for 
   power and sample size calculation in trio data.
